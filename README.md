## 💼 Projects

### **Mobile Application (Final Year Project)**
- For my **final year project** of Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I developed **SpotHub**, a mobile application built using **Flutter**, designed to help users discover and register food points in their area. The app provides a platform for food vendors to register their outlets, allowing users to explore nearby food points, check their menus, and give ratings also.

## 🎓 **Thesis: Enhancing Vulnerability Detection in Blockchain Smart Contracts**

I am currently working on my **Master's Thesis** focused on **Blockchain Smart Contract Security**, specifically on **enhancing vulnerability detection** in smart contracts. The goal of my research is to identify and mitigate common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, making blockchain-based applications safer.

In this research, I used the following tools and datasets to perform vulnerability detection and consensus analysis:

- **Tools Used**:
  - **Slither**: A static analysis tool for Solidity code that helps in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
  - **SmartCheck**: A tool that scans smart contracts for potential security risks and vulnerabilities.
  - **ChatGPT**: Used as A Vulnerability detection tool.

- **Datasets**:
  - **SmartBug Dataset**: A dataset that contains real-world smart contract vulnerabilities. I used it to calculate the **F1 score** of the vulnerability detection results produced by the tools.
  - **Etherscan-Generated Dataset**: A dataset sourced from **Etherscan**, containing data from deployed smart contracts, which I used to analyze and cross-reference the vulnerability findings.
 
- **Programming Languages**:
  - **Solidity**: The primary language used to write **smart contracts** on the Ethereum blockchain. In this research, Solidity was used to create and analyze smart contracts that are prone to common vulnerabilities.
  - **Python**: Used for various purposes, including:
    - **Data Processing**: Converting files from JSON (generated by tools like Slither and SmartCheck) into readable text formats for analysis and comparison.
    - **Data Visualization**: Leveraging libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize the results of the vulnerability detection, helping to identify patterns and trends in the data.

This thesis aims to contribute to the improvement of blockchain system security by enhancing the detection of vulnerabilities and ensuring the safety of decentralized applications.
