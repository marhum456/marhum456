## 💼 Projects

## Project 1: Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
- **Description**: Implemented a rapid, rule-based sentiment analysis system using TextBlob to classify tweets. Processed and analyzed over 5,600 tweets, successfully categorizing them into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments without requiring machine learning models.

## Project 2: ML Model Classification (Global Warming Belief Dataset)
- **Description**: Systematically compared SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression models with TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words feature extraction to classify tweets based on belief in global warming. Achieved 68% accuracy, identifying Logistic Regression as the optimal model.
